(the scinario is next i have table called(products_productcart) this table contain two column and both of them are forigen keys (cart_id) in this column it defines the customer cart .
(product_id) defines what the products client bought .
and (id) column it's primary key defins by defult from django .
so for example if we have 3 :
product_1 
product_2
product_3
and the client bought the three products the dataset will be :

id,cart_id,product_id
1,1,product_1
2,1,product_2
3,1,product_3

what i need is to make one column for the products like this for example if the client bought the three products to be one field combine the three products for example:

transaction
product_1,product_2,product_3





i think i gaved somthing rong i want a new table and the data be writen inside it in one column like this after pressing submting the payment code :

transaction
product_1,product_2,product_3
product_3
product_2


each row represent what client or customer bought
